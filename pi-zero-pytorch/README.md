## pi-zero-pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0">π₀</a> the robotic foundation model architecture proposed by Physical Intelligence

Summary of this work would be that it is a simplified <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/transfusion-pytorch">Transfusion</a> (Zhou et al.) with influence from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206">Stable Diffusion 3</a> (Esser et al.), mainly the adoption of flow matching instead of diffusion for policy generation, as well as the separation of parameters (<a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/mmdit/blob/main/mmdit/mmdit_pytorch.py#L43">Joint Attention</a> from mmDIT). They build on top of a pretrained vision language model, PaliGemma 2B.

Update: The [official repository](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) has been open sourced!

### Appreciation

- [Einops](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops) for the amazing [pack and unpack](https://einops.rocks/4-pack-and-unpack/), used extensively here for managing various token sets

- [Flex Attention](https://pytorch.org/blog/flexattention/) for allowing for easy mixture of autoregressive and bidirectional attention

- [@Wonder1905](https://github.com/Wonder1905) for the code review and identifying issues

- [Pranoy](https://github.com/pranoyr) for various bug fixes!

- You? maybe a phd student who wants to contribute to the latest SOTA architecture?

### Install

```bash
$ pip install pi-zero-pytorch
```

### Usage

```python
import torch
from pi_zero_pytorch import π0

model = π0(
    dim = 512,
    dim_action_input = 6,
    dim_joint_state = 12,
    num_tokens = 20_000
)

vision = torch.randn(1, 1024, 512)
commands = torch.randint(0, 20_000, (1, 1024))
joint_state = torch.randn(1, 12)
actions = torch.randn(1, 32, 6)

loss, _ = model(vision, commands, joint_state, actions)
loss.backward()

# after much training

sampled_actions = model(vision, commands, joint_state, trajectory_length = 32) # (1, 32, 6)
```

To do online learning, just wrap the model with the `EFPO` class

```python
from pi_zero_pytorch import π0, EFPO

# you'll want to supply your own environment

from pi_zero_pytorch.mock_env import Env
mock_env = Env((256, 256), 2, 32, 1024, 12)

# pass your agent and environment to EFPO for learning to be orchestrated

epo = EFPO(model)

# gather memories from environment

memories = epo.gather_experience_from_env(mock_env, steps = 10)

# learn from memories

epo.learn_agent(memories, batch_size = 2)
```

### Contributing

At the project root, run

```bash
$ pip install '.[test]' # or `uv pip install '.[test]'`
```

Then add your tests to `tests/test_pi_zero.py` and run

```bash
$ pytest tests/
```

That's it
